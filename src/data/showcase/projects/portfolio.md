## Project Goals

This project started out as a required learning portfolio for the [University Honors Program (UHP)](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/honors.html). Now it serves as a showcase of not only my learnings and experiences throughout my college life, but also my personal and professional life.

This portfolio is a house to:

#### Projects

A showcase of software projects that I have been a part of that have made an impact on my life. These range from work projects to personal hobby projects.

#### Experiences

These are projects that are required by the UHP as a form of self development. These are usually 3-4 month long and have specific self-development goals, pre-defined objectives and path, and a reflection at the end.

#### Blog

My personal blog with articles about everything from software development to coffee brewing.

## My Role

This is a solo project.

I started my software development journey with this wedding planner app. This was around when my brother was getting married, and Indian weddings have a tendency to be... _extravagant_. I took that opportunity to refine my learnings and get some hands-on development experience, as well as build something we could use to help the planning process.

I ran into [Meteorjs](https://www.meteor.com/) quite early in my life, and I loved how easy it is to have a full stack application up and running. It comes baked in with a lot of features while also maintaining a low learning curve.

**Hitch'd** is a web and mobile app that helps people track and manage multiple aspects of wedding planning, like invitations, budget and expenses, tasks, agendas etc. It was never completed with all the features that I intended, but I was able to complete some features, build a working application complete with user authentication, and deploy to Heroku and Google Play.

The project makes full use of some of the best features Meteor has to offer, like **realtime client-server communication** over websockets, **isomorphic code** in queries and methods, and built-in **cordova integration** to build for mobile.

Hitch'd is not deployed anymore, but the source code is available on my github.

## Project Goals

This is a project in collaboration with the **Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission** to collect criminal sentencing data from courts for analysis and research.

Information about the project can be found at: [https://www.ohiosentencingdata.info](https://www.ohiosentencingdata.info). The platform will achieve goals that include: using data to inform decision-making; improving transparency; and, making data accessible for the public, practitioners, and research. The collection of sentencing data in a comprehensive and searchable database will inform decision-making and give judges the tools and information needed to impose sentences in accordance with the purposes and principles of felony sentencing.

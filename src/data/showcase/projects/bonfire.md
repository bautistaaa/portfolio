## Project Goals

This is a project in collaboration with the **University of Cincinnati Corrections Institute** (UCCI), who developed a suite of assessments tools to be used at various decision points across the criminal and juvenile justice systems . The application enables agencies to assess and house risk/need data and support assessment-driven case planning. In addition, the application offers reporting, configuration, and administration features.

## Technology

The application is split into microservices behind an API Gateway. Our clients can use our web application interface, or develop their own solutions that consumes our externally-available API.

## My Role

My role on this project was to develop new features, migrate parts of the application to use newer technology, and maintain the production version of the application by supporting user requests and bug fixes.

This is the first software project that I got paid for. I got a freelance gig through a contact in Hong Kong. The project was for HealthyLovedOnes, a healthcare company based in Hong Kong. The application was a platform for caregivers to create their professional profiles, and get hired for jobs posted on the platform. Customers can create job postings with all the necessary details to find the perfect caregiver. They can also chat with the caregivers and pay them directly through the application.

Like my first project [Hitch'd](../hitchd), I used Meteor for this project, and made good use of most of the features that come out of the box. It does not have the best user interface because I am not very good at designing, but it is packed with features of a complete job search platform like Glassdoor.

The app is also translated into Traditional and Simplified Chinese. There were plans of growing the application with a lot more features and into east and south asian languages.

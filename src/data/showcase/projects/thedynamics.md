## Project Goals

This application is the primary platform for [TheDynamics](https://thedynamics.tech/) community. Members can create their profiles and showcase their projects, find professional or technical events that interest them, or find other members to collaborate with.

This platform will also be used to host [Codetivate](https://codetivate.thedynamics.tech/), TheDynamics's flagship virtual event.

## Technology

The project is a Next.js application deployed on Vercel, and the entire backend is in serverless architecture created using Next.js API Handlers. The application uses MongoDB as its database.

## My Role

I am the lead full-stack developer and architect on this project.

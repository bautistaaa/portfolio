But obviously, I couldn't have done it alone. Running an organization also meant leading an organizations,
which I was not good at. I still took the jump and held an election to get more executive members,
and then selected some people to be committee chairs. But I could not follow through on a lot
of things, especially sharing my passion and enthusiasm for hosting events and creating
a community. Many times I'd just reach out to others on the team for certain tasks, and
have to act as a kind of boss ordering someone to work on something. I did not want to do that,
but I couldn't come up with a better way to get everyone on the same page and collaboratively
organize an activity and get everything done on time. I also ended up doing pretty much 
everything by myself, because it seemed a much faster way to finish tasks.

While this gave me a lot of freedom to develop and implement
new solutions and automations, it also required me to lead the team and not do it alone.

As you might expect the same thing happened where I was not a capable enough leader
and ended up doing most of the work myself, because I could not share my passion and skills 
with everyone. While I would love to attribute this to the members' lack of interest,
as a leader I am always accountable for anything that happens in the team to some extent.

                    Student Leader Round Table

                <p>
                  As someone who is passionate about leadership and student
                  organizations on campus, the Student Leader Round Table was
                  the perfect opportunity for me to reflect on my experiences as
                  a leader, share my own learnings and wisdom, as well as learn
                  from other leaders in the university. Over the spring
                  semester, the round table (or the student leader illuminati as
                  I like to call it) met every other week and discussed a
                  specific issue related to running a student organization. Each
                  of us have had different approaches to the issues, so it was
                  great to hear how the specific situation of an organization
                  affects our approach of thinking about or solving an issue.

                <p>
                  We met for the very first time in January to get to know each
                  other and plan out the semester. We broke out into 2 groups,
                  and each group had to come up with 5 topics to talk about
                  throughout the semester. <br />
                  This session was probably the first time I have interacted
                  with other student leaders to talk about common issues in an
                  abstract manner.

                <h3 id="session-1">Session 1: Feb 2</h3>
                <p>
                  The first session topic was{" "}
                  <strong>Hybrid Meetings and Events</strong>. <br />
                  This is a relatively new issue for student organizations, ever
                  since COVID restrictions have relaxed. After the rise of
                  virtual meetings, organizations have discovered that the
                  convenience of attending an event from home is going to
                  forever change how we connect with our community. At the same
                  time, there are people who, after living in isolation for over
                  a year, really want to get back to face to face interaction.
                  So hybrid meetings seems like the best way to cater to every
                  audience. <br />
                  However, since hybrid meetings have never been properly
                  explored by anyone, let alone by student organizations. So we
                  discussed motivations, ideas, challenges, etc. It was a great
                  conversation that I learn a lot from, and hopefully it will
                  allow me to improve the hybrid meeting experience for my
                  organizations.

                <p>
                  The topic of our second session was{" "}
                  <strong>Recruitment</strong>. <br />
                  This is one of the most elementary issues that every
                  organization has to deal with. To stay relevant in the
                  community and continue to achieve our goals, we have to spread
                  awareness about our organizations' existence and attract
                  people who can contribute to the organization. <br />
                  The recruitment process has many different aspects, including
                  (but not limited to) identifying the target audience, figuring
                  out incentives and benefits, and formulating attractive
                  marketing material. <br />
                  To exercise formulating elevator pitches, we did the classic
                  "Sell me X in a minute" activity. The presenters chose a few
                  random images, and a volunteer had to come up with an elevator
                  pitch on the spot. This was a great exercise for me
                  personally, because I am often put in a situation where I am
                  in a conversation and I want to tell them about my
                  organization and what we do and why they should get involved.

                <h3 id="session-3">Session 3: March 2</h3>
                <p>
                  In our third meeting, we talked about{" "}
                  <strong>Executive Transition</strong>. <br />
                  Executive transition is an issue that usually lives in the
                  blind spot of organization leaders. If we are not conscious
                  about how we are handling transitions to the new executives at
                  the end of our tenures, the organization can potentially go
                  through a very difficult start and change into something else.{" "}
                  <br />
                  This mostly happens because every leader needs to have certain
                  frameworks and processes to run an organization. If those
                  frameworks are not handed to us by a previous leader, we will
                  come up with our own, which will take a lot of time to figure
                  out, and will be likely very different from what the previous
                  leaders used. <br />
                  We talked about the timeline of executive transition -
                  candidacy, elections, transitions and first meeting. For
                  candidacy and elections, we discussed what the candidates and
                  the voters need to know before the elections. We also
                  discussed how different organizations can have different
                  approaches to how the new executive is selected, or how
                  elections are executed. <br />
                  Every executive role has some essential core aspects, which
                  need to be clearly documented and shared with the newly
                  elected members. The easiest way to achieve that is to write
                  it in a document and hold a transition meeting between the
                  outgoing and incoming member.
                </p>
                <h3 id="session-4">Session 4: March 23</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the meeting that I presented in along with a partner,
                  and it was about <strong>Inter-Org Collab</strong>. <br />I am
                  very passionate about collaborations. I think collabs are a
                  great way to build up relationships, expand outreach, and get
                  access to more resources and do bigger projects. So that is
                  what we started the discussion with - benefits of
                  collaborating. <br />I had a lot of experiences and anecdotes
                  to share for this presentation, because almost all of ITSA
                  events have been a collab of some sort. They also helped me
                  come up with topics to talk about, as well as to make my
                  point. For example, I brought up the idea of the ITSA
                  partnering with a local cafe and coffee roaster to increase
                  awareness about specialty coffee. <br />
                  This specific meeting was also a little disappointing in some
                  ways. It finished in less than 40 minutes, where as all the
                  previous ones went on until the 50-55 minute mark. While some
                  of that can definitely be attributed to low attendance and
                  participation by the other members of the roundtable, I
                  definitely felt like the content we came up with in the
                  meeting was not enough. What makes it worse is that my partner
                  warned me of this, but for some reason I was confident that
                  the content we have in the slides was more than enough. In
                  hindsight looking at the slides of the other meetings, I
                  definitely under-prepared. <br />
                  However, even though I did not get much feedback from the
                  other members on this topic, just the preparation had an
                  immense impact on how I think about collaborations, and it
                  helped me organize a lot of my random thoughts and opinions
                  into a clear framework, which I can document further.
